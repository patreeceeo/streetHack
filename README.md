# streethack
For collaborating on ideas about a hackathon where contestants can only use materials found that day on the street.

## white (or gray?) hat hacking only
- no steal
- no weapons
- be kind

## democratic judging
all contestants can vote on who they think the winner should be. They can vote for their own project or another team's project.

## radical inclusion
you don't have to be a "hacker," a "maker," a technologist or anything like that. All skills and ability levels are welcome. Contestants can work with a team or solo.

## public good
cleaner streets as a side effect

## questions/unknowns
- location/venue?
